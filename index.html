      This is your first birthday with me and I wish it will continue till my last breath. Love you from the deepest part of my heart and wish you all the luck. I made this 
        website to save every moment between us and also to remember our goal, which is being just for each other as a wife and husband. everytime we do something new I'll save 
        it here till we finish our four chapters and have our little babies. We will make our story step by step together as we like with all we have, love moments, sad ones, 
        hard time, all we face are memories and we must save it forever. I hope you like it, I really made this with all my love, althoug that's not alot but you always deserve 
        the best Hanonti. Love you forever.... <br>
        Your man<br>
        Ziko
